                <p>The 3rd Brigade was constituted 19 November 1917 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 8th Infantry Brigade, as an element
                    of the 4th Infantry Division. It was organized in December 1917 at Camp Greene, N.C. The Brigade has been reorganized
                    and redesignated several times over the years. Finally, on 15 December 1970, it was activated at Fort Carson, Colo.,
                    as 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.</p>
                <p>When the Division Headquarters moved to Fort Hood, Texas in 1995, the brigade remained at Fort Carson and was redesignated
                    as the 3rd Brigade Combat Team (3rd BCT). In May 2006 the brigade completed its transformation to the Army's modular
                    design.
                </p>
                <p>The brigade has received numerous campaign participation credits, including Aisne-Marne and Meuse-Argonne During World
                    War I; Counteroffensive, Phases II-VI, and Tet Counteroffensive in Vietnam; and Operation Iraqi Freedom I of the
                    War on Terrorism to name a few. A few of its more prestigious decorations include the Presidential Unit Citation,
                    the Valorous Unit Award, the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm, and the Republic of Vietnam Civil
                    Action Honor Medal, First Class.</p>
                <p>The 3rd Brigade Combat Team is comprised of nearly 3,800 Soldiers including: 4th Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment; the
                    1st Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment; the 1st Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment; the 3rd Battalion, 29th Field Artillery
                    Regiment; the 3rd Special Troops Battalion; and 64th Brigade Support Battalion.</p>
                <p>The 3rd BCT has deployed four times in a span of seven years in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom; from 2003-2004, 2005-2006,
                    2007-2008 and later, Operation New Dawn from 2010-2011. In Iraq, the brigade's mission included several key areas:
                    neutralizing the anti-Iraqi forces, building a capable Iraqi Security Force, legitimizing a responsive government,
                    and putting Iraqis in the lead. During the latter half of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the beginning of Operation
                    New Dawn, from March 2010-2011, the 3rd BCT had the mission to serve as an advise and assist brigade responsible
                    for advising, training, and assisting Iraqi Security Forces. During that deployment, they provided training and assistance
                    to Iraqi security forces, while simultaneously assisting the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) in helping the
                    Iraqi government rebuild its civil capacity and infrastructure. While there, the brigade fell under the command of
                    the 1st Infantry Division and the 36th Infantry Division in the southern four provinces of Iraq.</p>
                <p>Along with its organic elements, the brigade partnered with two Iraqi Army Divisions, 10th IA Division and 14th IA Division;
                    4th Region DBE with the 9th, 10th, and 14th Brigades; three ports of entry one each at Safwan, Al Sheeb, and Shalamcheh;
                    one Federal Police Brigade; the Iraqi Highway Police in Dhi Qar Province; and Iraqi police with four separate provincial
                    directors of police. The brigade also partnered with four PRT, responsible for securing movement, assessing projects
                    and managing commanders' emergency response funds.</p>
                <p>The brigade's units worked with their partners diligently; training, mentoring and providing enablers when needed to
                    assist the Iraqis to develop an effective and lethal security force capable of defeating the anti-Iraqi forces and
                    supporting the elected government. The 3rd BCT returned to Fort Carson in March 2011.</p>
                <p>The 3rd BCT sent more than 300 of its officers and senior noncommissioned officers in April and May of 2012, on a nine-month
                    deployment to the southern provinces of Afghanistan to help mentor and train current Afghan National Security Forces
                    (ANSF). While supporting their deployed leadership, the remaining “Iron Brigade” Soldiers, NCO's and officers continue
                    to train and prepare to maintain combat readiness to fulfill any future mission requirements.</p>

                    and again in 2008, and was awarded two Meritorious Unit Citations. The unit's most recent deployment was in 2010
                    in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, after which the brigade was awarded a Valorous Unit Award. Task Force Iron
                    Eagle supported 22 allied nations across four regional commands, the largest geographical area of any combat aviation
                    brigade.
